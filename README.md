# qemuNextSTEPpatches
These are my ancient (ca. 2005) patches to enable bus mouse support for qemu, 
which someone updated to work with qemu 0.9.0.

These are currently required for running NextSTEP intel in qemu, since its
PS/2 mouse driver does not work with the qemu-provided PS/2 mouse emulation.
